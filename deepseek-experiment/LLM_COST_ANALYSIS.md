# LLM API Cost Analysis for Trading Bot

## Overview

This document analyzes the daily costs of running your trading bot with different LLM providers. The analysis is based on your current configuration of running every 5 minutes (300 seconds) with structured prompts.

## Current Bot Configuration

- **Run Interval**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Daily Cycles**: 288 cycles per day (24 hours × 60 minutes ÷ 5 minutes)
- **Prompt Structure**: Market data + Portfolio state + Trading rules
- **Response Format**: Structured JSON with action, confidence, reasoning, etc.

## Token Usage Estimation

### Per Trading Cycle
Based on your prompt structure in `src/llm_client.py`:

**Input Tokens (per cycle)**:
- Market data: ~50 tokens
- Portfolio state: ~80 tokens  
- Trading rules: ~100 tokens
- System prompt: ~200 tokens
- **Total Input**: ~430 tokens per cycle

**Output Tokens (per cycle)**:
- JSON response: ~150 tokens
- **Total Output**: ~150 tokens per cycle

### Daily Token Usage
- **Input Tokens**: 430 × 288 cycles = **123,840 tokens/day**
- **Output Tokens**: 150 × 288 cycles = **43,200 tokens/day**
- **Total Tokens**: **167,040 tokens/day**

- Optimize JSON response structure

### 3. **Conditional LLM Calls**
- Only call LLM when significant market changes occur
- Use technical indicators to trigger LLM analysis
- Implement confidence-based decision caching

### 4. **Hybrid Approach**
- Use cheaper model for routine decisions
- Reserve expensive model for complex situations
- Implement fallback mechanisms

## Real-World Cost Examples

### Conservative Trading (10 cycles/day)
- **DeepSeek**: $0.001/day ($0.36/year)
- **GPT-3.5**: $0.004/day ($1.46/year)
- **GPT-4**: $0.028/day ($10.22/year)

### Aggressive Trading (1000 cycles/day)
- **DeepSeek**: $0.10/day ($36.50/year)
