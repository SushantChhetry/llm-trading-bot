# Alpha Arena-Style Trading Bot Enhancements

This document outlines the enhancements made to align the trading bot with the Alpha Arena methodology described in the research paper.

## Overview

The Alpha Arena approach focuses on:
- Concise instruction sets (system prompts)
- Live market + account state (user prompts)
- Leverage-enabled perpetual futures trading
- Structured decision outputs with exit plans
- 2-3 minute inference cycles
- Advanced risk management

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Structure ✅

**Before:**
- Basic market data and portfolio state
- Simple trading rules
- Limited context about fees and leverage

**After:**
- Professional trading environment context
- Detailed trading parameters (leverage, fees, position sizing)
- Comprehensive risk management guidelines
- Alpha Arena-style concise but complete instructions

**New Prompt Features:**
- Maximum leverage guidance (10x)
- Trading fees specification (0.05% taker)
- Position sizing based on available cash and leverage
- Risk management principles (max 2% risk per trade)
- Structured response format with exit plans

### 2. Leverage Support ✅

**Implementation:**
- Added leverage parameter to all trading functions
- Margin-based position sizing (notional value / leverage)
- Proper balance management for margin requirements
- Leverage validation (1.0x to 10.0x range)

**Key Features:**
- `execute_buy()` now accepts leverage parameter
- `execute_sell()` supports leverage context
- Margin calculation: `required_margin = amount_usdt / leverage`
- Balance updates based on margin, not full notional value

### 3. Enhanced Decision Format ✅

**New LLM Response Structure:**
```json
{
    "action": "buy|sell|hold",
    "direction": "long|short|none",
    "quantity": 0.0,
    "leverage": 1.0-10.0,
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "justification": "Brief explanation",
    "exit_plan": {
        "profit_target": 0.0,
        "stop_loss": 0.0,
        "invalidation_conditions": ["condition1", "condition2"]
    },
    "position_size_usdt": 0.0,
    "risk_assessment": "low|medium|high"
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Added direction field (long/short/none)
- Leverage specification
- Exit plan with profit targets and stop losses
- Invalidation conditions for plan voiding
- Position size in USDT for clarity

### 4. Exit Plan System ✅

**Features:**
- Pre-defined profit targets
- Stop loss levels
- Invalidation conditions (market volatility spikes, unexpected news)
- Integration with trade records
- Risk management through planned exits

**Implementation:**
- Exit plans stored with each trade
- Validation conditions for plan invalidation
- Profit/loss tracking against targets
- Risk assessment integration

### 5. Advanced Risk Management ✅

**New Risk Controls:**
- Maximum leverage limits (configurable)
- Position sizing based on available cash and leverage
- Trading fees calculation (0.05% taker)
- Maximum risk per trade (2% of portfolio)
- Margin-based balance management

**Configuration Options:**
```python
MAX_LEVERAGE = 10.0
DEFAULT_LEVERAGE = 1.0
TRADING_FEE_PERCENT = 0.05
MAX_RISK_PER_TRADE = 2.0
```

### 6. Optimized Inference Loop ✅

**Timing Changes:**
- Reduced cycle time from 5 minutes to 2.5 minutes (150 seconds)
- Aligns with Alpha Arena's 2-3 minute cycles
- Faster feedback and learning loops
- More responsive to market changes
